> 1. Goblin - * I like Goblin because for its unique blend of fantasy, romance, comedy, and drama, offering a captivating storyline that explores theme of love, destiny, and the supernatural. The well-developed characters, specially the bromance between the goblin and the grim reaper, contribute to the show's charm. Additionally the memorable soundtrack further enhance the overall appeal of Goblin.
